    Training Day - CODEACADEMY Ex.

    As a seasoned althlete one of your favourite activities is running marathons. You use a service called Training Days that sends you a message for the event you signed up for and the days you have left to train.
    Since you also code, Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: The prog currently uses the wrong scope for it's variables. They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this project you will make Training Days more  maintainbale and less error prone by fixing variable scopes.

    Rock, Paper, Scissors - CODEACADEMY ex.
    Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game.Each player chooses either Rock paper or scissors. The items are compared and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.
    Possible outcomes: rock destroy scissors
    scissors cut paper
    paper covers rock

    3.Compare the tow choices and determine a winner.
    4.Start the program and display the & results.

    Team-stats - CODEACADEMY ex.
    We want to create,retrieve and add information about your favourite sports team.  Basketball,soccer, tennis or water polo, you pick. Its your job to create data using the JavaScript data structures at your disposal:arrays and objects.
    After we create these data structures in this project- feel free to challenge yourself to gain insights from them. For e.g you might want to get the total number of games your team has payed or the average score of all their games.

    Secret Message - CODEACADEMY ex. Arrays

    Whale Talk - CODEACADEMY ex Loops
    Take a phrase like 'turpentine and turtles' and translate it into it's whale talk equivalent: "UUEEIEEAUUEE".
    there are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:
    1-There are no consonants
    2- The u's and e's are extra long so we must double them in our program

    Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly as it a custom in the ocean.
    To accomplish translation, we can use our knowledge of loops.

    Grammar Checker - CODEACADEMY ex Iterators
    Use iteration over arrays to gather information and improve the quality of a paragraph
