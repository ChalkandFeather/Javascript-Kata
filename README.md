    Training Day - CODEACADEMY Ex.

    As a seasoned althlete one of your favourite activities is running marathons. You use a service called Training Days that sends you a message for the event you signed up for and the days you have left to train.
    Since you also code, Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: The prog currently uses the wrong scope for it's variables. They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this project you will make Training Days more  maintainbale and less error prone by fixing variable scopes.
